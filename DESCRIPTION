Title: Mixed Effects Random Forest Models for Asset Pricing
Description: Implements various longitudinal random forest models for asset pricing
    applications, including Mixed Effects Random Forest (MERF), Mixed Effects
    Random Tree (MERT), and Random Effects EM Tree (REEMtree) and the standard RF (Random Forest). The package
    provides both standard and stochastic variants of these models to capture
    temporal dependencies in financial data. Methods are based on Capitaine et al. (2020)
